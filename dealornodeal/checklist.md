1. Start with a utility range that is way smaller than 1.7M

range is now 729?
2. Make zero sum
3. Get convergence of CFR and EFR (tips or causal)
4. Check the utilities (higher on cfr than tips)? 


- Convergence should be measured in exploitability for zero sum case, and regret measure for general sum
- Understand difference between causal, blind and tips regret
